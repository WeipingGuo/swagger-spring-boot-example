# swagger-spring-boot-example
An example project to show usage Swagger with Spring Boot

I used to use Swagger to document API and it worked pretty well, however, I am still have trouble to make it seamlessly work with Spring Boot. Following the discussion over stackoverflow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27861872/unable-to-get-swagger-ui-working-with-spring-boot, I am creating a sample project to show how it works.

The Swagger-UI is successfully launched for the initial commit, unfortunately have trouble to retrieve API docs. 

### NOTE
It only works with Tomcat. I just Jetty, unfortunately, no luck so far.
