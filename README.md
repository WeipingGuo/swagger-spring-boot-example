# swagger-spring-boot-example
An example project to show usage Swagger with Spring Boot

## Background
I used to use Swagger to document API and it worked pretty well, however, I am still have trouble to make it seamlessly work with Spring Boot. Following the [discussion over stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27861872/unable-to-get-swagger-ui-working-with-spring-boot), I am creating a sample project to show how it works.

The Swagger-UI is successfully launched for the initial commit, unfortunately have trouble to retrieve API docs. For now, I am switching to [JSONDoc](http://jsondoc.org/) simply because it works well with Spring boot. 


### NOTE
It only works with Tomcat. No luck for Jetty so far.
